# Day 2: Git and GitHub

2023-10-10

## What is Git?

- Git is **version control software**

- You can think of it kind of like the "track comments" function in MS Word or Google Docs, but for code (plain text)

## Why use Git?

- To share code
  - Important for **reproducibility**. Other people can't reproduce your analysis if they can't access your code

- To have a history of all the things your tried in your analysis
  - You can go back and see what you have changed. Especially important **when something breaks**.

- To organize how you develop your code
  - You will make comments about all your changes to your code ("commits"), so this forces you to think about **how** you are writing your code

## What is GitHub?

- An online tool for managing projects that use Git

- Acts like a cloud backup tool for your code

- Makes it easy to share code with others

## Setup

- You need to install git on your computer **and** set up an account on <https://github.com>

## Instructions to install git

- [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
  - May need to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) first

- [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

- [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

## Setup GitHub account

- Navigate to <https://github.com/> and follow the prompts

## Setup GitHub authentication: PAT

A PAT is a "Personal Access Token". It is like an extra-secure password.

There is another method for authentication called SSH, but it's a bit more complicated to set up. If you want to use SSH, see these [instructions](../appendix.html#setup-github-authentication-ssh).

## Create PAT on GitHub

- Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens

Or, from R, do:

```
usethis::create_github_token()
```

- Look over the scopes (permissions); “repo”, “user”, and “workflow” are recommended. Recommended scopes will be pre-selected if you used `create_github_token()`.

- Click “Generate token”.

## Save your PAT

- Copy the generated PAT to your clipboard. DON'T CLOSE THE BROWSER WINDOW YET.

- Install gitcreds in R with `install.packages("gitcreds")`

- Next, run `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`.

- Enter the PAT that you copied from GitHub. Now you can close the browser window.

Done!

## A few more notes about PAT

- Your PAT will expire (after 30 days by default).

- You then need to re-create a new one on GitHub and enter it again with `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`.

- Using an expiration date is recommended for security

## Introduce yourself to git

You need to let git know your GitHub username and email address:

``` bash
git config --global user.name "your_github_username"
git config --global user.email "your_email_adress"
git config --global --list
```

## About repos

- A 'repo' (short for repository) is a folder where you store all the code and other files needed for a project.

**git tracks the content of a repo**

## Remote and local repos

- A **local** repo is just the project on your own computer

- A **remote** repo is a copy of the repo online (on GitHub)
  - Somewhat confusingly, the remote repo is typically referred to by the name `origin`

## Cloning

Sometimes, you want to download a repo that doesn't exist on your computer yet.

- **Cloning** is copying an online repo to your computer

## Pushing and pulling

Once you have the repos set up, you need to keep them in sync.

- You **push** changes from your local repo to the remote

- You **pull** changes from the remote repo to your local one

## Commits

- A **commit** is a single change made to a repo that you have stored in git's history.

There are two steps to making a commit.

## Staging and committing

A file that has been changed is not automatically added to git's history.

- You need to **stage** the file (or part of the file) that you want to add to a particular commit

- Next, you type a short message describing the change, the **commit message**

- Finally, you **commit** the change to log it in git's history

## The `.gitignore` file

If there are any files you don't want git to track, you can ignore them by listing them in a special file called `.gitignore`.

It is usually a good idea to ignore **raw data files** and **output files**. We only want to track code (in other words, the analysis iteself)

## How this works in practice

We will go through a typical git workflow together in class using RStudio.

This is explained in the ["Intro to Git" markdown file](https://github.com/data-analysis-chiba-2023/day02-git/blob/main/day02_intro_to_git.md), which you will copy to your computer when you clone the [Day 2 repo](https://github.com/data-analysis-chiba-2023/day02-git/).
