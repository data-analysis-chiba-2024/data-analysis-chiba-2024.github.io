## What is data analysis?

- Obtaining **insight** from **data**

- Important for **many careers** (academic and industry)

> Employment of data scientists is projected to grow **35%** from 2022 to 2032, **much faster than the average for all occupations**.

## Why programming?

Who has used Excel? Who has used a programming language?

What are the **advantages** and **disadvantages** of each for data analysis?

- Discuss with your neighbor

## Why programming? 

- Programming allows you to **record every step** of data analysis
  - This means you can **repeat your analysis!**

It takes some time to get used to, but eventually you will feel more comfortable with it because you can re-trace your steps and **have confidence** in your results.

## Why reproducibility?

**When** might you want to repeat an analysis? **Why?**

- Discuss with your neighbor

## Why reproducibility? {.incremental}

- If new data comes in and you need to update an analysis

- If you want to double-check your own results

- If you want to repeat somebody else's analysis

- **If you switch between different projects and can't remember exactly what you were doing**

## Goals of this class

The goal of this class is to learn the fundamentals of reproducible data analysis by **doing it yourself**.

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- load, clean, and visualize data using R
- track changes to code using Git and GitHub
- write a reproducible report using Quarto

## Expectations of this class

- I expect you to **participate in discussions**

- I expect you to **ask questions**

## Language of this class

- This class is **conducted in English**

- But, you can ask questions in Japanese and I will explain in Japanese if needed

## Recommended Reading

- R for Data Science. <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/>
  - Available in Japanese from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Rではじめるデータサイエンス-Hadley-Wickham/dp/487311814X) or [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.co.jp/books/9784873118147/)

- Happy Git with R. <https://happygitwithr.com/>

- Introduction to Reproducible Publications with RStudio <https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/Reproducible-Publications-with-RStudio-Quarto/index.html>

## Homework assignments

- There will be a **homework assignment** on **GitHub** for each class, starting next week.

- You submit the assignment by making a **commit** in Git (more about this on Day 2)

## Final project

- You will need to analyze a dataset of your own choosing for your final project, due 2024-07-24 11:59 PM

- The last homework assignment is due 2024-07-10 11:59 PM, so you have at least 2 weeks to work on the final project

## Schedule

- Day 1 (2024-06-06): Introduction: Why code? Why reproducibility?

- Day 2 (2024-06-13): Git and GitHub

- Day 3 (2024-06-20): Basic usage of R and RStudio

- Day 4 (Media Day): Data loading and tidying with tidyverse

## Schedule (cont'd)

- Day 5 (Media Day): Data tidying, part II

- Day 6 (Media Day): Data visualization with ggplot2

- Day 7 (2024-07-11): Writing documents with Quarto

- Day 8 (2024-07-18): Quarto, part II

## Grades

- In-class participation 25%
- Homework 25%
- Final report 50%

**No late submissions allowed** (exceptions may be made for medical emergencies)

## Course website and slides

- All slides (and other info) available at<br><https://data-analysis-chiba-2024.github.io/>

## Moodle

- **Assignments** (GitHub classroom repos) will be posted on Moodle

- **Check Moodle every week**

## Office hours

By appointment: contact me at <joelnitta@chiba.u-jp>

## Questions?

## ChatGPT {.incremental}

- Who has used ChatGPT before?
  - <https://chat.openai.com/>

- You may use ChatGPT for your homework and final project

- But first you need to know **how to use it**

## ChatGPT {.incremental}

- ChatGPT **makes statistical predictions** about words based on training data (it does not "think")

- ChatGPT is designed to produce sentences that **sound** as natural as possible

- ChatGPT may **lie to you** or make up facts (called "hallucination"; this is especially common when it lacks adequate training data)

## ChatGPT policies (DOs) {.incremental}

- *Do* try by yourself first (without ChatGPT)

- *Do* ask it **detailed**, **specific** questions (prompts)
  -  <https://www.promptingguide.ai/> ([日本語](https://www.promptingguide.ai/jp))

- *Do* **double-check** the results: does ChatGPT's code produce the expected result?

- *Do* make sure you **understand** the code that ChatGPT provides

## ChatGPT policies (DON'Ts) {.incremental}

- *Don't* copy-paste directly from ChatGPT for your report.
  - Typing the code yourself will help you remember it and understand what you are doing. Copy-pasting text for a paper is plagiarism.

- *Don't* submit an answer from ChatGPT without trying/checking it yourself first
  - ChatGPT could very well be wrong!

## Setting up RStudio

- [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

- [Install RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

## Setting up Git

We will follow instructions for [Day 2](../day2/#/setup) to set up Git
